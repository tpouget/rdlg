This project aims at developping an application allowing users to order their lunch to a given restaurant called "Restaurant De La Gare". The restaurant will be notified by e-mail.

The application is hosted on Google App Engine.
The client-side is made using Google Web Toolkit 1.7 and Ext-GWT 2.0.
Thus everything has been setup thanks to the Google plug-in for Eclipse and the application is exclusively written in Java.
